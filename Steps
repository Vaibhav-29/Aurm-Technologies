Step 1: Data Collection and Storage

Collect a dataset of bank branch information, including geolocation (latitude and longitude), pincode, brand, and facilities provided. This data could be obtained from sources like government databases, bank websites, or third-party data providers.
Store this data in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for efficient retrieval and processing.
Step 2: Geolocation-based Search

Create an API endpoint that accepts a geolocation (latitude and longitude) as input and a radius (e.g., 5KM).
Use a spatial database or a library like GeoDjango to perform geospatial queries to find all bank branches within the specified radius.
Return a list of bank branches along with their brand and facilities as JSON data.

Step 3: Pincode-based Search

Create an API endpoint that accepts a pincode as input.
Query the database to find all bank branches within the specified pincode.
Return a list of bank branches along with their brand and facilities as JSON data.
Step 4: Categorization

Categorize bank branches based on their brand and facilities provided. You can create a classification system or use existing data for this purpose.
Display categorized branches on the user interface.
Step 5: Building APIs and UI

Create RESTful APIs using a framework like Django REST framework or Flask for the geolocation and pincode-based searches.
Develop a user interface (UI) using a web framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js. Use API calls to fetch and display data on the UI.
Implement user-friendly features like search boxes, filters, and map visualization (using libraries like Leaflet or Google Maps).
Step 6: Deployment

Deploy your application on a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and set up a production-ready database server.
Secure your APIs and UI with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Consider using a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalability and reliability.
